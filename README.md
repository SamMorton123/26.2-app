# Introducing TwentySix.Two V1
TwentySix.Two is a little side project I started in December 2020 to apply data science and some basic sports analytics to elite track and field. Here you'll find a simple web app developed in Streamlit to showcase my first round of elite track and field rankings. Due to disruptions in the sport due to COVID-19, I found it best to publish only the rankings following the 2019 World Championships for now.
